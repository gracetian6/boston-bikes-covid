# Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Boston's Bikeshare Program (R)

In this data analysis project, we explore three hypotheses: 

1. First, we hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted usership of
bikeshare. This may have consequently changed the primary users of Bluebikes. We plan to
use predictive models to assess how bike usership has changed with LASSO, random forest,
and mixed modeling techniques and see how they compare by considering MSEs and ANOVA
testing.

2. Second, as lockdown has grown longer, the longing for life to go back to “normal” has
increased. Our exploratory data analysis of bike share frequency over time brings up interesting
questions about lockdown fatigue. Unlike biking in 2018 and 2019, the bike share frequency in
2020 has an unusual U shape. This begs the question - is bike share in 2020 better modeled by
a quadratic U shape due to the lockdown orders? Or is this simply caused by weather effects
that are similar across other years?

3. We hypothesize that there is lockdown fatigue, i.e. the longer the social distancing procedures
are in place, the less people stay inside and bike more. Municipalities such as Cambridge or
Brookline may also be different from that of Boston proper. Is there a difference in bike sharing
between these districts?
